## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js, MySQL.  I was motivated to build this project to showcase my capabilities with MySQL.  It was built because most companies need the ability to track their employees via databases.  It is intended to solve the problem of information not being easily accessible or manipulatable.  In making said project, I learned about MySQL queries and the npms: Inquirer, dotENV, and MySQL2.

## Features

- Upon startup, the words: "FOUNDATION DIRECTORY" are logged in the console and a list of options are given.

- When the "View All Employees", "View All Roles", or "View all Departments" options are selected, they are formatted in an easily readable way and displayed.

- When the "Add Employee" option is selected, more prompts are given about the new employee and the employee is logged in the database.

- When the "Inquire About Departments" option is selected, another prompt about which department to inquire about is given and the user input is displayed and formatted in an easily readable way.

- When any action is completed, the initial prompt is given again to allow for quick traversal of the information.
